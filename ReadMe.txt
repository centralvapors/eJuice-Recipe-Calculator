INSTALLING
==========
Required: Microsoft .net Framework 3.5
UnZip to Temp folder or run WinZip by double
clicking on ejuiceMe.zip. Double click on the setup.exe and
follow the prompted instructions.

UNINSTALLING
==============
Setup also installs an "uninstall" utility to allow easy 
removal from your system. Select "Add/Remove Programs" or
"Programs and Features" from the Control Panel
to uninstall the software.

Saving File - Don't have Permission
===================================
If you are using Windows 7, 8 or Vista and receive this pop up window:
 "You don't have permission to save to this location. Contact your Administrator".
If you get this message when trying to SAVE a recipe file that you created, you will need to run the program as an Administrator.

Work around:
Right Click the "eJuice Me Up" icon and then click "Properties",
Click on the "Compatibility" TAB and
check the box "Run this program as an Administrator".

Gram Weight
===========
I have seen people state different gram weights than others. It depends on the accuracy of an individual’s scale.
To precisely know the weight for YOUR scale, weigh out 1 ml of each liquid and add the gram weight by going to the menu item "Tools", "Gram Set".
When you first start up eJuice Me Up before entering a recipe, enter your gram weights that you measured out and click on: "File", "Save as Default".
Keep the file name as "Default.dft". This way each time you create a recipe the gram weights will be intact.
Recipes are saved as two files, ".rec" and ".rec2". They must be saved or kept in the same folder. The default folder is the one that the program was installed in. If you find that setting your gram weight for an existing recipe does not retain the gram weight, check that the ".rec2" file is saved to the folder in which you are keeping your ".rec" file.

Drops Measuring
===============
When mixing small batches the drop method may be okay.
On average, 20 drops are equal to 1 ml. That depends on the consistency of the liquid. So experimenting may be needed. The thicker the liquid, the bigger the drops. Drops are NOT an accurate measurement.
The most accurate method of measuring is with a graduated syringe or cylinder.
I would highly recommend to NOT use drops for measuring.

REGISTRATION
===============
NONE required. This is absolutely FREE software.
No adware or spyware.

Nicotine Warning!
=================
Nicotine Handling:

    * * Nicotine is an extremely toxic substance. More so that arsenic, milligram for milligram. Its extraction, storage and use in e-liquid pose a significant risk to the user and anyone who might come into contact with it.
    * * Never allow nicotine to touch your skin or allow it to build up in the atmosphere. Always wear suitable protective clothing and keep workspaces well ventilated.
    * * Extreme caution must always be applied in the handling of nicotine, especially where children are concerned - a drop of e-liquid that might make a long-term smoker feel sick will likely kill a child.
    * * All items contaminated by nicotine extraction or e-liquid mixing must be cleaned or disposed of accordingly. Treat it as toxic waste - do not allow it to pollute the environment or remain unattended or unsecured at any time. Contact your local authority to find what provisions there are for hazardous waste disposal before you attempt any e-liquid production.
    * * E-liquid and all substances used in its production must be stored securely away from children and pets and in child-proof bottles.
    * * Appropriate care must be taken to safeguard against fire-hazards. Many ingredients in e-liquid are highly flammable, as are many substances used in the extraction of nicotine. 


Even following these guidelines cannot guarantee your safety.


Health effects of nicotine

Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor; it constricts arteries, making it harder for the heart to pump blood through the body. Repeated nicotine exposure contributes to accelerated coronary artery disease, acute cardiac ischemic events, and hypertension Additionally, studies have shown that nicotine exposure contributes to stroke, peptic ulcer disease, and esophageal reflux. Further, nicotine may cause wounds to heal more slowly and may be associated with reproductive toxicity. Moreover, nicotine can cause the body to release its stores of fat and cholesterol into the blood
